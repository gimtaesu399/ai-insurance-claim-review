# 🤖 AI-Powered Insurance Claim Review System

> **A comprehensive full-stack application that automates insurance claim processing using advanced AI technologies including computer vision, OCR, and machine learning.**

## 🎯 Project Overview

### **Problem Statement**
A Korean Kyobo Life branch manager requested an **automated insurance claim review system** to address critical business challenges:
- **Manual Review Bottleneck**: Human reviewers spend 4-6 hours per claim, causing customer dissatisfaction
- **Fraud Detection Limitations**: Manual forgery detection has only 60-70% accuracy
- **Inconsistent Processing**: Human error leads to inconsistent claim assessments
- **Customer Experience**: Long waiting times (2-3 weeks) for claim resolution

### **Solution**
As the **Backend Developer**, I designed and implemented an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** insurance claim review system using dummy data to demonstrate the core functionality. The system leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to automate the traditionally manual process of insurance claim assessment.
